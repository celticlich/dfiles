# dotfiles

This is a collection of my personal dotfiles which are a mishmash of things I've found scattered across the web (mostly here
on github).


fzf-1pass.sh:
Wrapper for use with https://github.com/dcreemer/1pass

tkillpane.sh
wrapper for killing off tmux panes interactively

heretic-config.sh:
this is my work in progress script for building/rebuilding Linux/MacOS machines. Primarily geared to MacOS for now.

b.rb:

.mymacros.bash:
Allows for creation/use/deletion of fzf-based macros.
