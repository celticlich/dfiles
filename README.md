# heretic's Dotfiles

This is a collection of my personal dotfiles which are a mishmash of things I've found scattered across the web (mostly here
on github).

## Installation

Do the clone thing and go nuts

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pherondk/dotfiles
```

## Usage

```bash
  fzf-1pass.sh:
  Wrapper for use with https://github.com/dcreemer/1pass

  tkillpane.sh
  wrapper for killing off tmux panes interactively

  heretic-config.sh:
  this is my work in progress script for building/rebuilding Linux/MacOS machines. Primarily geared to MacOS for now.

  b.rb:
  Browse Chromium based browser bookmarks in fzf and open in default browser

  .mymacros.bash
  Allows for creation/use/deletion of fzf-based macros.

  addmac - create new macro
  vimac - edit existing macro
  delmac - delete specified macro
```
